# scripts
Menu driven shell scripts for debian based OS to:
1. Update and upgrade os.
2. Clean old apt packages and snap packages.
3. Install and configure nvim with all the essentials.
4. Remove nvim completely.
5. Install all the required softwares on a newly installed OS aka Fill Slate Protocol.

**The idea behind writing these scripts is to save time and all the hassle of finding the right commands/package names and nvim configuration on the internet.**

## How to use?
1. Download and extract the repo to your home directory.
2. Run menu script using command,
```shell
bash menu.sh
```
